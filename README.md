# Solar_Production 

## From kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/solar-power 

## This repository contains 2 very similar notebooks for 2 different solar production plants, with power generation and weather values used.

## Various models are used to predict the solar DC_POWER output from the IRRADIANCE - xgboost, linear regression in detail and  decision tree regressor, support vector regressor, Lasso, random forest regression and extreme gradient boost regressors
